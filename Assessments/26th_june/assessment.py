Project Description: Create a bank account management system that allows users to create and manage 
their bank accounts. The system should allÃ³w users to perform basic banking operations
like depositing and withdrawing money, checking balance, and viewing transaction history.

Steps to Implement:

1. Create a BankAcount class that will have the following attributes: account number, account holder name, 
account type (Savings or Checking), and balance.
2. Define a constructor method that will initialize the account attributes when a new object is created.
3. Define methods for depositing and withdrawing money from the account. These methods should update 
the balance attribute accordingly.
4. Define a method for checking the current balance of the account.
5. Define a method for displaying the transaction history of the account.
6. Create a main function that will allow users to create new accounts and perform banking 
operations on their accounts.
